        With this update \"Ninja Browser\" is used as base for \"Browser\". The
    concept remains the old: simple but powerful with a nice looking user interface. Main advantage of this step are a better
    implementation of tabs. Now you can open as many tabs as you wish. Also you have a new startpage. Please read the new
    \"Help dialog\" for more information.&lt;br>&lt;br>

        - new: Chinese translation (Thanks: lishoujun)&lt;br>
        - new: close current tab in menu&lt;br>
        - new: share text to browser&lt;br>
        - improved: hide/show toolbar&lt;br>
        - fix: night mode (now in UI settings)&lt;br>
        - fix: force close when clicking direct download link&lt;br>
        - fix: screenshot, when started via holder service&lt;br>
        - fix: some strings&lt;br>
        - fix: possible force close on Android > Nougat
