# browser
A simple Android webbrowser based on webview.

I want to introduce my new app "Browser". As the name says, it's a browser, It is based on webview. There are no tabs. The app is organized in lists (see below). I developed this because I wanted a lightweight browser with all the cool features I saw on several browser all together in one app.

I want to release the app on f-droid. So if anybody has suggestions or finds bugs, please tell me. You can find the source code here. So have a nice try. Downloads in the second post.

### The lists:

- bookmarks
- history
- readLater: links not worth to be a bookmark, but at the moment you do not want to read...
- passStorage: save links withe login data (username, password)


### Some nice extra features:

- fully compatible with Android 7.1 (?)
- full material design
- open links in background
- search on site
- screenshots of the whole website
- build in file browser (open, share, rename, delete files)
- optimized for one hand handling (toolbar on bottom, swipe on toolbar to reach bookmarks and readLater list and to finish app)


### What features will not be implemented:

- tabs (I know, it's the normal way, but I have no idea how to implement. I learned all about developing from tutorials, so I'm not as good as you might think...)
- Ad blocker (there are more than enough apps to do that better)


### Planed features:

- whitelist for javascript
- password protection
- fullscreen optional
