### The lists

- passStorage: save links withe login data (username, password)


### Security/Data

- enable/disable cookies, javascript, location access, form data
- whitelist for javascript
- pin protection
- toggle image loading
- offline use
- backup databases


### UI/Handling

- optimized for one hand handling (omnibox at bottom)
- Android 7 app shortcuts
- full material design
- Navigation through websites: arrows and/or swipe
- fullscreen browsing (optional)


### Search

- fast search on different websites
- search on site


### Some nice extra features

- open links in background
- screenshots of the whole website
- build in file browser (open, share, rename, delete files)


### What features will not be implemented

- tabs (I know, it's the normal way, but I have no idea how to implement. I learned all about developing from tutorials, so I'm not as good as you might think...)
- Ad blocker (there are more than enough apps to do that better)
